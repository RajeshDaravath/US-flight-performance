The dataset consisted of perfromances of approximately 653700 flights. The performance data included various features of which the main variables of interest arrival delay, departure delay, cancellation, arrival time, departure time, origin and destination airports, unique carriers. The data set can be found here http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

## Summary of Findings

I have looked at the realtion between cancellation code and various variables to see how delays are responsible for cancellation. Most cancellations have occurred due to carrier delay and weather delay.Also the canellation due to Security delay being almost negligible. Expected relationships were found in this part of the investigation. A number of outliers were found in the delay plots and most of the data points were plotted in a small region. Also correlation plot between the numeric variables was plotted at the beginning of this exploration which shows us that, Late aircraft delay and carrier delay shows a reasonable correlation with the arr delay and dep delay.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I've found that from the correlation plot which is plotted in this investigation, Which shows a reasonable strong correlation between arr delay, dep delay and (late aircraft delay, carrier delay).Carrier delay is also the main reason for cancellation which has been observed from the plots in the univariate exploration part. Which states that carrier delay is the main reason for cancellation, arr delay and dep delay of most of the flights. From the selected carriers UA(United Airlines) and AA(American Airlines) are the two airlines with most canellations and delays. The airports which are home to cancellations and delays are ORD and DFW. Thus it can be concluded that carrier delay is the main reason for most of the flights being cancelled and delayed with the carriers being UA, AA and aiports DFW, ORD.
